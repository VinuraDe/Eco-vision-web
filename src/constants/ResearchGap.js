  introText: `While various solutions have been developed for industrial emission monitoring, significant gaps remain in terms of optimizing the management of emissions and providing real-time mitigation strategies. Many existing systems primarily focus on detecting pollutants and monitoring air quality, but they often fail to incorporate advanced analytics that can predict and prevent emissions from exceeding safe levels. Moreover, these systems typically do not account for optimizing process parameters, which could play a crucial role in reducing emissions more efficiently.
  Another limitation in existing approaches is the lack of real-time alerts that can be acted upon instantly by stakeholders. While monitoring systems collect data, the absence of immediate notifications based on dynamic thresholds prevents timely interventions that could help mitigate environmental risks. Additionally, edge analysis is rarely utilized, meaning that data processing and alerts are delayed, reducing the systemâ€™s effectiveness in rapidly changing industrial environments.`,

  conclusionText: `Our proposed system addresses these shortcomings by integrating real-time monitoring with predictive algorithms to identify potential emission spikes before they occur. It also optimizes process parameters regularly and employs edge analysis to ensure that alerts are sent instantly to stakeholders, enabling faster decision-making and reducing environmental impact. This holistic approach not only enhances emission control but also promotes sustainable industrial practices.
